### Coding Playground

Repository for testing ideas, PoCs and practicing programming.

**DISCLAIMER!!**

Some solutions here may be not the best or optimal ones. Everything in this directory is done for learning and experimentation purposes.

I treat this repository as:
1. Worklogs
2. Bin where I put everything that is worth remembering but doesn't have its own place anywhere else
3. Things that could have been Github Gist but landed here instead

That's all :)
